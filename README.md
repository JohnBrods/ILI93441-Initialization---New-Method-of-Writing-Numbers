# ILI93441-Initialization---New-Method-of-Writing-Numbers
C File for ILI9341
This C file contains everything to write numbers on an ILI9341 without the need to blank the characters to change the character.
It is as demonstrated on youTube.
The 'Write number' function has now been updated, see the latest video and a link to the new file.
Thank you John B. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmw92P38ffk
Feel free to donate a coffee for the work creating the custom 'write number function' link in YouTube via 'show more'.
